We did this paper as the final project for Data Mining Class at CSUN.

# COMP 541. Data Mining

### A study of the concepts, principles, techniques and applications of data mining. Topics include data preprocessing, the ChiMerge algorithm, data warehousing, OLAP technology, the Apriori algorithm for mining frequent patterns, classification methods (such as decision tree induction, Bayesian classification, neural networks, support vector machines and genetic algorithms), clustering methods (such as k-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering methods and self-organizing feature map)and data mining applications (such as Web, finance, telecommunication, biology, medicine, science and engineering). Privacy protection and information security in data mining are also discussed.
